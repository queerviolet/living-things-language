  simplify: *simplify_title
  note: |
    Hi, my name's Ashi. Today's talk is the first in a series called
    *Living Things*. This one is about language.
  I'm making a language:
    note: |
      I am actually writing a programming language. This is not the big
      reveal. It's not ready for that yet. But I'm fascinated by the
      process. Fascinaged and terrified.

      Because it's... in some sense, totally free. It could really become
      anything. It's the thing most like pure math that I've ever done.
      I'm venturing out into this world of concepts. Just walking into this
      foreign land, and then drawing up borders. Like I'm British or something.
      
      And in that sense? It's all very arbitrary.
  Not All Arbitrary:
    note: |
      But in another sense, it's not arbitrary at all. There are some
      shapes—some borders—that are clearly wrong. And there are some that are
      clearly right. Fewer of those, irritatingly. But they *are* there.

      It's like... there's something this language wants to be.

      It's taking shape, and it's taking its *own* shape.
  Languages Are Living Things:
    note: |
      We've all heard that languages are living things. I think we treat this
      as metaphor. Languages that are spoken by people today—those we call "alive".
      Languages that are no longer spoken—or are only spoken by a select
      group of academics—those we describe as "dead".

      For the next thirty minutes, I want you to try and take this
      as literally as possible. Hopefully I'll do a bit to convince you
      of this. Languages do not breathe, they do not
      metabolize, but they do shape the worlds of their speakers,
      they reproduce, they consume resources, they come into equilibria
      with their environments—environments which, notably, include our minds
      and bodies.
  Language is Powerful:
    note: |
      Language is powerful. Ancient and contemporary magical systems rely
      on the power of naming. The names we give to the things in our world
      create that world. We say the hardest problem in computer science
      is giving name to things. And that's because names matter. Names
      are connected to meanings, linked into this web of implications
      that fishes from out of the depths of our minds everything from machine
      schematics to childhood trauma.
  Language is in The Body:
    note: |
      Language has a reputation for being airy. Disconnected from the
      physical. From our bodies. "Shhhhhh," your lover might say. No
      talking now. Just dance.

      But this reputation, I think, conceals a vital truth: language
      is a thing of the body. Our bodies are made for language. For sign,
      for speech, for song. And language is a thing that grows out of
      our bodies, is rooted in movement, has evolved with us, and is as
      much a thing of our bodies as our thumbs, as our frontal cortex,
      as our dance.

      So right now...
Remember:
  frame: title
  simplify: *simplify_title
  note: |
    I want you to remember.

    Remember that you have a body.
    
    Remember your lungs, peeling open to draw in air
    so the hemoglobin inside them can release CO2 and trap oxygen.
    
    You are alive, so you are made up of living things.
  
  Cells:
    frame: title
    simplify: *simplify_title_2
    note: |
      Remember the cells of your body. Remember the fibers of your muscles.

      Remember your heart, squeezing and squishing your blood around to drive
      oxidization in your cells.
      
      Remember that oxidization is burning, and so inside of you are thirty seven
      trillion tiny fires.
  Crackling:
    frame: title
    simplify: *simplify_title_3
    note: |
      Remember the crackling of depolarizing membranes in your brain, neurons
      strobing with information.
      
      You are alive, so you are a part of living things. You are a cell
      within tissues shaped like cities and families and nations.

      You are alive, so you hvae come from living things.
      Remember your ancestors. Remember the story that has brought you here.
      Remember your past.

      Remember... about ten years ago.

      No longer would we be beholden to newspapers, to reporters. No longer would
      we get our stories filtered through layers of intermediaries,
      each one spinning and slanting. No, we would just get the truth.
      The truth would win.
    Naysayers:
      note: |
        Of course, there were nay sayers. Negative nancies.
        "Journalists", "researchers", asking...
        okay, well, how? How, exactly? How do you know people are who they
        say they are? How can you trust these faceless barely-people,
        veiled by layers of cable and protocol?

        And our response—my response, certainly, the one I said on the
        inside—was that it's... fine... probably. Something something
        web of trust. Wisdom of crowds.

      Good job, Cassandra. We probably should have listened.

      Yeah. But we didn’t.
      
      And now, we’re all... completely fucked.

      I believe we will grow cities from trees,
      I believe we will create space for all living things.
      I believe in us.
      
      But goodness, we don't make it easy.

      I mean, Uncle Sam, always a bit of a crotchety racist,
      is *really* not looking so hot these days.
      
      And it's not just him. There's a lot of scary things happening
      all over the world.
      
      I wouldn't have believed it if you'd told me ten years ago.
  May not believe it now:
    bg: black
    note: |
      In fact, I get a lot of my news from Twitter, so I only kindof
      believe it now.

      What’s the saying? Falsehood flies, truth comes limping after.
      And this makes sense! We should expect this.

      There are so very, very many things that can go wrong in
      communication, it's a miracle we are able to communicate anything
      at all.

      But we do. Reliably, repeatedly, across great distances.

      With a powerful new technology.

      That technology is language.

      There's a lot of theories on how language came to be.
Origins of Language:
  bg: black
  video: dna-drew-berry.mov

  html: |
    <cite>Animation: Drew Berry, WEHI</cite>
  note: |
    One theory, favored by Noam Chomsky, says that it arose suddenly, about
    100,000 years ago, the result of a small number of mutations in a singular
    individual that gave that person's brain the ability to process what Chomsky
    calls "digital infinity".
    
    This powerful capability spread like a seed crystal in the early human mind,
    opening up the capacity for language and modern human cognition.
    
    You may know it by its other name: recursion.
  
Recursion:
  htmlFunc: |
    () => `<div class=pan-content-up>${
      Array.from({length: 5}, () => `<div class=layer>&#8220;It
        was a dark and stormy night, and the captain said to the bosun,
        <p>&#8220;Tell us a tale,&#8221;
        <p>And the bosun began&#8230;`).join('')
    }${Array.from({length: 5}, () => '</div>').join('')}</div>`
  note: |
    I think we all know and love recursion.
  
  Opens but never closes:
    bg: threed
    note: |
      In this story, the recursive frames open, but never close. That's the joke.
      That's also what makes it, for lack of a better term, so *tingly* to experience.

      You have this real sense of infinity, of this capacity with ourselves to begin
      in each moment a new story, embedded within the last.

More Common Phrases:
  html: |
    <span class=p>the cat
      <span class=p>that killed
        <span class=p>the bird
          <span class=p>that ate
            <span class=p>the rat
              <span class=p>that ate
                <span class=p>the cheese</span>

            </span>
          </span>
        </span>
      </span>
    </span>
  note: |
      Of course, more common phrases feature recursive embedding.  
  Embedding:
    bg: p-expand
    note: |
      All human languages contain the ability to expand at their
      phrases indefinitely.

      Here, we can keep expanding this noun phrase by adding complementizers,
      which themselves contain noun phrases, a recursive embedding that creates
      the possibility of an infinitely long sentence, built through the recursive
      application of a finite number of rules. Digital infinity.

      It's this feature of language that allows us to define an unbounded
      conceptual space. Language is an instinctive articulation of the math
      embedded in our squishy personal neural networks.
The Recursive Mind:
  img: the-recursive-mind.jpg
  note: |
    In his book *The Recursive Mind*, Michael Corballis theorizes that it is this
    capacity for recursion that distinguishes human thought from the cognitive
    processes of other animals.
  Three:
    note: |
      Corballis, in fact, identifies a magic number: three. Three layers. Three
      stack frames, if you will, seems to be about the number of recursive layers
      that humans can hold at once.

      Which is... enough.
  Past present future:
    note: |
      One stack frame gives you a moment. Two gives you a delta—a direction.

      But three? With three stack frames, we can hold the past, present,
      and future: a temporal triumverate that's nearly universal in human
      experience, represented in the tenses of nearly every language.

      With three stack frames, we get direction, and meta-direction. We get
      stories.
  We are stories:
    note: |
      And that is the root of the self: we are stories telling ourselves.

      We're all familiar with it: the little voice inside our head. It
      speaks in our voice. Our inner narrative.

      Turns out, it's not so inner.
Subvocalization:
  img: phonological-loop.jpg
  note: |
    Our inner voice is part of a system in our brain called the phonological
    loop, part of Baddeley & Hitch's model of working memory.

    When you read the words on this diagram, you hear them.
    "Prefrontal Cortex: Attention Controller".  
  Actually Saying Them:
    note: |
      Turns out you hear them because you are *actually saying them*.
      
      Almost.

      You're saying them, just... very quietly. Without any vocal
      oomph to go with it.

      When you speak internally, you *subvocalize*.
      
      That is, your brain actually sends to your body the a softer
      shadow of the motor impulses that would cause
      you to speak the words. For sign language users, these motor
      impulses go to the arms, hands, and face. For speaking people,
      they go to the tongue and larynx.
  Echoes:
    note: |
      Echoes of these impulses then return to the brain. You feel a
      *little* like you're actually hearing speech, or seeing signs.
      This sensation can then be processed by the same mechanisms we
      use to process words said by anyone else.

      Reading the written word is, effectively, a type-coercion operation.
      We need to convert pictures of words into a stream of words-meanings.
      And since we *already have* a way to convert words that we hear or
      signs that we see into word-meanings, our brain just... uses that.
  The Loop:
      note: |
        This process also gives longevity to the words we're holding in our
        head.

        The Baddley model holds that there is effectively no storage for
        words that exists purely in the brain. We have a short-term
        phonological store, but information held there decays very quickly,
        unless it's committed to long-term memory, or refreshed.

        Refreshing our word buffer is where the "Loop" part of the "Phonological
        Loop" comes in. If we want to hold some piece of information in
        our minds, we need to refresh our phonological store through rehearsal.

        You’re familiar with rehearsal: it’s what you’re doing when you mutter
        a phone number to yourself, over and over
        
        ..."8675309" "8675309"...
        
        ...Trying to keep the memory of it from decaying. You are bouncing
        the pattern of the words off your body so that you can perceive them
        again and refresh your memory.

        So this is how our brains store words in working memory. Using
        our bodies as buffers.
  Reading:
    note: |
      Subvocalization is particularly noticeable in kids, because it's often
      not "sub" at all. I remember watching my niece play when she was younger.
      She would narrate what she was doing, constantly, to nobody in particular.

      And this that's pretty normal. Early in the language-acquisition phase, you'll
      often find kids narrating their inner speech out loud, or by explicitly
      signing it, before developing subvocalization.
            
      Same thing with reading. We mostly learn to read by reading aloud, and
      traces of this fact never really go away.
  Evidence:
    note: |
      In fact, one of the pieces of evidence for this comes from reading
      comprehension. If you make people hold their tongues against the
      roofs of their mouths while they're reading a passage, they show
      poorer comprehension of the text than people who you've gotten to
      do some unrelatedly annoying motor task, like tapping their fingers.

      Pinning the tongue literally pins your inner tongue, muffling your
      inner voice.

      This is an almost bizzarely prosaic explanation for something that
      seems so intimate: our inner voice.
      
      If this is happening, surely we could detect it? And even do speech
      recognition on it?
Subvocal Speech Recognition:
  img: mit-silent-speech.jpg
  bg: black
  note: |
    Yes, we can.

    Arnav Kapur at MIT has built a proof of concept silent computing platform,
    which uses speech recognition via Electromyography—reading the electrical
    impulses sent to your muscles.
    
    Using this input, the system is able to perform speech recognition on
    the words you're saying in your head. It can reply to you as well, via
    bone transduction.

    All this to create a silent computing platform that can be an
    “intelligence augmentation device.”

    It recognizes the question you're saying in your head, asks
    Google about it, and answers by vibrating the bones of your jaw.
  
Baddley Diagram Again:
  img: phonological-loop.jpg
  bg: white
  note: |
    This diagram identifies key brain areas that have been shaped by
    language. Here, we see the phonological loop located in the Broca's
    and Wernicke's areas of the brain—areas of the cortex commonly
    associated with language.

    But there's a growing body of evidence that there's another part of
    the brain that's quite important for language:

Cerebellum:

      <img id=soboCerebellum src='${res['sobo-cerebellum-pink.png']}'>
    `
  note: |
    The cerebellum is quite special.
    
    It contains half the neurons in our nervous system.

    All action commands from the brain to the body route through it
    
    All sensations from the body to the brain, too
    
    It has long been recognized as vitally important to our motor coordination.
    
    Like this: **touch end of clicker**
    
    People with cerebellar damage have difficulty performing this action smoothly.
    
    With cerebellar damage, our movements become jerky, laggy.
  Smith Predictor:
    bg: black
    html: |
      <cite>Miall, Weir, Wolpert, and Stein — Is the cerebellum a Smith Predictor? (1993)</cite>
    note: |
      It's theorized that the cerebellum acts as a Smith predictor.
      Our brain's controller for our latency-distant bodies
      able to estimate the body's current state
      integrate sensory feedback to update that model
      and decompose gross actions generated elsewhere in the brain
      into a fine-tuned, continuously adjusted control signal

      Once you've evolved it, such a thing has many uses.  
  Movement is a Reduce Operation:
    bg: black
    note: |
      Processing movement is a kind of reduce operation.

      Say you're trying to spear a bison.

      First, you need to know where the bison will be by the time you
      throw the spear. So you take a stream of input from your senses
      and decode observations. Based on the patterns of light and dark
      cast on your retina, you recognize shapes and patterns and, eventually,
      creatures, movement, and gestures.

      Then you reduce that stream of gestures into a model for the bison:
      where is it going to be at some future time `t`?

      Now you know where you want the spear to be. So now, all you have
      to do is run that entire process in reverse, to create a sequence
      of commands for your own movements that will deliver the spear
      to that point, at time `t` in the future.

      Then you cue those commands, and throw the spear.
  Language is Reduce:
    bg: black
    note: |
      Language, too, is a reduce operation.

      When we're listening, we are reducing a sequence of words into a
      meaning: a model describing the movement of the speaker in cognitive
      space.

      When we speak, we need to serialize an inner meaning into a sequence
      of words.

      With both language and movement, we are transforming coordinate
      spaces: translating the state of our inner worlds—a point within
      some space of all possible experiences—into a sequence of moves
      that will move us to that point.

      Whether the point is cognitive or physical doesn't really matter—the
      math is the same. Language is dance; dance is communication.
  Translation Dance:
    bg: black
    note: |
      I was just in Mexico. And one evening there, I had the fascinating
      experience of of listening to some Mexican and Columbian folks talking
      —in Spanish—about the differences between Colombian
      Spanish and Mexican Spanish.

      My Spanish is pretty bad. I didn't know all the words. But I was able
      to follow this conversation.  Partially because a lot of it was literally
      explanation, but also because... they were dancing around each other.
      
      It didn't matter that I didn't know all the words, because they were
      exploring the graph, revealing the connections, revealing the topography
      of a cognitive landscape.
  Shows Up in How We Talk:
    bg: black
    note: |
      The physicality of language shows up in other ways. It shows up in how
      we talk. A *lot*.
      
      We take *stances* on issues: yours might be on the left, or the right.

      When we've said too much, we walk back.

      When you walk back too often, you're flip-flopping, or dancing around
      the issue.

      We move towards ideas we want to embody and distance ourselves from
      ideas we no longer like.
  All Metaphors:
    bg: black
    note: |
      These are all metaphors, of course, but I'd argue that our readiness
      to liken concepts to positions suggests that they are processed
      very similarly in our brains. The newly-evolved faculty of language
      relying on ancient circuits evolved to do the hardest thing in the world:
      move around in it.
Gradual Origins:
  bg: white  
  note: |
    All this may also suggest an origin for language that's quite different from
    the discontinuous origin offered by Chomsky.

    There are some open questions with that story, after all.

    For one thing, even if the capability for language is a small enough
    set of mutations to have spontaneously arose in a single individual,
    how did *language* arise? Language, after all, is a process of
    communication. Who did Prometheus talk to?

    For another...

    note: |
      Language has deeply shaped our bodies. The human voice box is capable
      of some pretty incredible feats, feats no other animal can quite
      reproduce.
      
      Some birds do a remarkably good facimile, but our primate cousins
      don't. Tell me, Mr. Anderson, what good is recursive grammar when you
      are unable to speak?
    Gesture-first theory:
      bg: white
      note: |
        Michael Corballis and others have offered a solution: language did
        not arise with speech. It arose with gesture. The first languages
        were *sign* languages.

        And this seems at least viable. We know of primates who can use sign
        language. And once sign language is established, there are some good
        adaptive reasons to transition to the spoken word. For one thing, speech
        allows us to communicate over greater distance, when line of sight isn't
        available, and when our hands are otherwise occupied—possibly with spears.

        Of course, the machinery has to change little. We already use acoustic
        information to build up a physical model of our surroundings. Tweaking
        *how* that information is integrated seems almost within the plasticity of
        our individual brains, to say nothing of the capacity for evolution to
        change the structure of those brains.
    Other theories:
      bg: white
      note: |
        There are other gradualist theories of the origin of language. Some folks
        say language began as grunts intended to synchronize manual labor. Heave, ho.

        Others—and I do love this theory—say that it began as baby talk: coos
        and babble between mothers and children that slowly gained semantics.

        Some literally say that language started as dance.

        I doubt we'll ever be able to truly disentangle which of these theories
        actually happened. Not that it matters so much. All these theories speak
        to truths about language. They all sound plausible enough; we can see
        each theory reflected in our experience of language today.

  Tree:

    html: <cite>art by Mina Sundberg</cite>
    note: |
      We have now a perfusion of languages spread across the globe.

      This beautiful tree, drawn by Mina Sundberg, just shows the old world
      languages, those from Europe and Asia.
      
      Most of them are descended from Proto-Indo-European, a language spoken
      by people in the Ural steppes four to six thousand years ago.

      There are, of course, many more.

      There were earlier languages we have since forgotten, and it was these
      earlier langauges which shaped our bodies, giving us vocal chords, and
      shaped our minds, giving us stories. Narrative, that thread from which
      we weave our cognitive worlds.

      That's power. And it flows both ways. Language, this thing we made without
      even fully realizing we were making it, has shaped us just as much as we've
      shaped it.

      Where does language exist? A particular language, the English language,
      where is it?

      Well, it's in me. It's a program, running in my mind. But not just mine.
      It's in yours, too. And hers, and his.
      
      It's a distributed program running on a biological strata. A concept
      given tenancy on an infrastructure of many minds.

      Each one of us holds a shard. Language is organized into shards, just
      as we are organized into cells.
      
    Replicate:
      bg: black
      note: |
        The shards replicate. They are taught and learned.
        
        The shards adapt. The language we learn is not exactly the language
        we were taught. The language of youngs, rather famously, is not
        quite the language of olds.

        Biological systems, too, are made of self-replicating components, and
        because of this they adapt and grow and come to homeostasis.
        
        They are governed by laws of statistical mechanics which guide them
        into shapes that can effectively obtain energy and convert it into heat.

        And language too, evolves in this way. Everything we build evolves.

        Everything comes alive.

        Everything we make joins an ecosystem that includes us.

        That shapes us.

        That becomes a part of us.
