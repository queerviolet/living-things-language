Hi:
  frame: title
  simplify: *simplify_title
  note: |
    Hi, my name's Ashi. Today's talk is the first in a series called
    *Living Things*. This one is about language.
  Languages Are Living Things:
    note: |
      We've all heard that languages are living things. I think we treat this
      as metaphor. Languages that are spoken by people today—those we call "alive".
      Languages that are no longer spoken—or are only spoken by a select
      group of academics—those we describe as "dead".

      For the next thirty minutes, I want you to try and take this
      as literally as possible. Hopefully I'll do a bit to convince you
      of this. Languages do not breathe, they do not
      metabolize, but they do shape the worlds of their speakers,
      they reproduce, they consume resources, they come into equilibria
      with their environments—environments which, notably, include our minds
      and bodies.
  Language is Powerful:
    note: |
      Language is powerful. Ancient and contemporary magical systems rely
      on the power of naming. The names we give to the things in our world
      create that world. You've heard, I'm sure, that the hardest
      problem in computer science is giving name to things. And that's
      because names matter. Names are connected to meanings, linked into
      this web of implications that fishes out of the depths of our minds
      everything from machine schematics to childhood trauma.
  Language is in The Body:
    note: |
      Language has a reputation for being airy. Disconnected from the
      physical. From our bodies. "Shhhhhh," your lover might say. No
      talking now. Just dance.

      But this reputation, I think, conceals a vital truth: language
      is a thing of the body. Our bodies are made for language. For sign,
      for speech, for song. And language is a thing that grows out of
      our bodies, is rooted in movement, has evolved with us, and is as
      much a thing of our bodies as our thumbs, as our frontal cortex,
      as our dance.

      So right now...
Remember:
  frame: title
  simplify: *simplify_title
  note: |
    I want you to remember.

    Remember that you have a body.
    
    Remember your lungs, peeling open to draw in air
    so the hemoglobin inside them can release CO2 and trap oxygen.
    
    You are alive, so you are made up of living things.
    
    Remember the cells of your body. Remember the fibers of your muscles.

    Remember your heart, squeezing and squishing your blood around to drive
    oxidization in your cells.
    
    Remember that oxidization is burning, and so inside of you are thirty seven
    trillion tiny fires.
    
    Remember the crackling of depolarizing membranes in your brain, neurons
    strobing with information.
    
    You are alive, so you are a part of living things. You are a cell
    within tissues shaped like cities and families and nations.

    You are alive, so you hvae come from living things.
    Remember your ancestors. Remember the story that has brought you here.
    Remember your past.

    Remember... about ten years ago.
  Ten Years Ago:

  Socially networked:
    frame: socially-networked
    note: |
      *socially* networked, made by us, consumed by us.
      Bloggers and tweeters sharing their worlds with each other.
      
      All of us creators, all of us consumers.

      No longer would we be beholden to newspapers, to reporters. No longer would
      we get our stories filtered through layers of intermediaries,
      each one spinning and slanting. No, we would just get the truth.
      The truth would win.
      
      Of course, there were nay sayers. Negative nancies.
      "Journalists", "researchers", asking...
      okay, well, how? How, exactly? How do you know people are who they
      say they are? How can you trust these faceless barely-people,
      veiled by layers of cable and protocol?

      And our response—my response, certainly, the one I said on the
      inside—was that it's... fine... probably. Something something
      web of trust. Wisdom of crowds.

  A New Culture:

      We have been weaving ourselves a new culture.

      Connecting in a new way.
  Without Nations and Borders:
    frame: fist2
    bg: black
    note: |
      Richer. More direct.
      Organic. We are becoming something, all of us together
      becoming something greater than any of us. It seemed,
      then, that we were struck by lightning, and far from
      killing us, it gave us life, and our mycelium was bearing fruit.
      
      This is why we built everything. Remember that feeling?
      The promise of the Internet, of cyberspace, this new kind
      of a place without nations and borders, a place where
      authoritarians fear to tread.
  Punch Only Masks:

    note: |
      A place where their iron fists can punch only masks;
      where their walls cannot be built because the network perceives
      their censorship as damage and routes around it. Where we rely
      on each other. On consensus. On the wisdom of the mob.
      A place where every story can be told, true or not.
  Racism:

      A place where
      your footprints can follow you forever. A place where you can
      be yourself and so can anyone else; a place where everyone can
      find their people and dance in 14/88 time;
  New Minds:
    frame: eye0
    bg: black
    note: |
      a place where new minds
      are growing, and they’re sprouting eyes everywhere, and their
      hands are everywhere, and they are learning from us how to be
      human and so far they can reliably emulate three things

  Retrospect:
    bg: black
    note: |
      In retrospect, those journalists, those researchers,
      everyone concerned, perhaps even alarmed about how we would
      be able to trust anything in a world with amplification and
      no accountability? They had a really solid point. Just...very solid.
      Good job, Cassandra. We probably should have listened.

      Yeah. But we didn’t.
      
      And now, we’re all... completely fucked.
  What happened:
    bg: black
    note: |
      Maybe.
      
      It certainly feels that way sometimes.
      
      I believe life will thrive.
      I believe we will touch the stars.
      I believe we will grow cities from trees,
      I believe we will create space for all living things.
      I believe in us.
      
      But goodness, we don't make it easy.

      I mean, Uncle Sam, always a bit of a crotchety racist,
      is *really* not looking so hot these days.
      
      And it's not just him. There's a lot of scary things happening
      all over the world.
      
      I wouldn't have believed it if you'd told me ten years ago.
  May not believe it now:
    bg: black
    note: |
      In fact, I get a lot of my news from Twitter, so I only kindof
      believe it now.

      What’s the saying? Falsehood flies, truth comes limping after.
      And this makes sense! We should expect this.

      There are so very, very many things that can go wrong in
      communication, it's a miracle we are able to communicate anything
      at all.

      But we do. Reliably, repeatedly, across great distances.

      With a powerful new technology.

      That technology is language.

      You may disagree with me calling language a technology.
      
      You may say it's not physical. But as all of us here at this programming
      language conference know, technologies do not have to be physical.

      It doesn't have a singular inventor, either. In fact,
      some elements of language acquisition seem to be hardwired into
      us. Communities will create language if it isn't given to them.

      But many of our technologies do not have singular inventors. Many
      of them have been discovered and re-discovered time and again,
      in many different places.

      There's a lot of theories on how language came to be.

Origins of Language:  
  note: |
    One theory, favored by Noam Chomsky, says that it arose suddenly, about
    100,000 years ago, the result of a small number of mutations in a singular
    individual that gave that person's brain the ability to process what Chomsky
    calls "digital infinity".
    
    This powerful capability spread like a seed crystal in the early human mind,
    opening up the capacity for language and modern human cognition.
    
    You may know it by its other name: recursion.
  
Recursion:
  htmlFunc: |
    () => `<div class=pan-content-up>${
      Array.from({length: 5}, () => `<div class=layer>&#8220;It
        was a dark and stormy night, and the captain said to the bosun,
        <p>&#8220;Tell us a tale,&#8221;
        <p>And the bosun began&#8230;`).join('')
    }${Array.from({length: 5}, () => '</div>').join('')}</div>`
  note: |
    I think we all know and love recursion.
  
  Opens but never closes:
    bg: threed
    note: |
      In this story, the recursive frames open, but never close. That's the joke.
      That's also what makes it, for lack of a better term, so *tingly* to experience.

      You have this real sense of infinity, of this capacity with ourselves to begin
      in each moment a new story, embedded within the last.

More Common Phrases:
  html: |
    <span class=p>the cat
      <span class=p>that killed
        <span class=p>the bird
          <span class=p>that ate
            <span class=p>the rat
              <span class=p>that ate
                <span class=p>the cheese</span>
              </span>
            </span>
          </span>
        </span>
      </span>
    </span>
  note: |
      Of course, more common phrases feature recursive embedding.  
  Embedding:
    bg: p-expand
    note: |
      All human languages contain the ability to expand at their
      phrases indefinitely.

      Here, we can keep expanding this noun phrase by adding complementizers,
      which themselves contain noun phrases, a recursive embedding that creates
      the possibility of an infinitely long sentence, built through the recursive
      application of a finite number of rules. Digital infinity.
The Recursive Mind:
  img: the-recursive-mind.jpg
  note: |
    In his book *The Recursive Mind*, Michael Corballis theorizes that it is this
    capacity for recursion that distinguishes human thought from the cognitive
    processes of other animals.
  Three:
    note: |
      Corballis, in fact, identifies a magic number: three. Three layers. Three
      stack frames, if you will, seems to be about the number of recursive layers
      that humans can hold at once.

      But that's enough.
  Past present future:
    note: |
      One stack frame gives you a moment. Two gives you a delta—a direction.

      But three? With three stack frames, we can hold the past, present,
      and future: a temporal triumverate that's nearly universal in human
      experience, represented in the tenses of nearly every language.

      With three stack frames, we get direction, and meta-direction. We get
      stories.
  We are stories:
    note: |
      And that is the root of the self: we are stories telling ourselves.

      We're all familiar with it: the little voice inside our head. It
      speaks in our voice. Our inner narrative.

      Turns out, it's not so inner.
Subvocalization:
  img: phonological-loop.jpg
  note: |
    Our inner voice is part of a system in our brain called the phonological
    loop, part of Baddeley & Hitch's model of working memory.

    When you read the words on this diagram, you hear them.
    "Prefrontal Cortex: Attention Controller".  
  Actually Saying Them:
    note: |
      Turns out you hear them because you are *actually saying them*.
      
      Almost.

      You're saying them, just... very quietly. Without any vocal
      oomph to go with it.

      When you speak internally, you *subvocalize*.
      
      That is, your brain actually sends to your body the a softer
      shadow of the motor impulses that would cause
      you to speak the words. For sign language users, these motor
      impulses go to the arms, hands, and face. For speaking people,
      they go to the tongue and larynx.
  Echoes:
    note: |
      Echoes of these impulses then return to the brain. You feel a
      *little* like you're actually hearing speech, or seeing signs.
      This sensation can then be processed by the same mechanisms we
      use to process words said by anyone else.

      Reading the written word is, effectively, a type-coercion operation.
      We need to convert pictures of words into a stream of words-meanings.
      And since we *already have* a way to convert words that we hear or
      signs that we see into word-meanings, our brain just... uses that.
  The Loop:
      note: |
        This process also gives longevity to the words we're holding in our
        head.

        The Baddley model holds that there is effectively no storage for
        words that exists purely in the brain. We have a short-term
        phonological store, but information held there decays very quickly,
        unless it's committed to long-term memory, or refreshed.

        Refreshing our word buffer is where the "Loop" part of the "Phonological
        Loop" comes in. If we want to hold some piece of information in
        our minds, we need to refresh our phonological store through rehearsal.

        You’re familiar with rehearsal: it’s what you’re doing when you mutter
        a phone number to yourself, over and over
        
        ..."8675309" "8675309"...
        
        ...Trying to keep the memory of it from decaying. You are bouncing
        the pattern of the words off your body so that you can perceive them
        again and refresh your memory.

        So this is how our brains store words in working memory. Using
        our bodies as buffers.
  Reading:
    note: |
      Subvocalization is particularly noticeable in kids, because it's often
      not "sub" at all. I remember watching my niece play when she was younger.
      She would narrate what she was doing to nobody in particular.

      And this is pretty normal. Early in the language-acquisition phase, you'll
      often find kids narrating their inner speech out loud, or by explicitly
      signing it, before developing subvocalization.
            
      Same thing with reading. We mostly learn to read by reading aloud, and
      traces of this fact never really go away.
  Evidence:
    note: |
      In fact, one of the pieces of evidence for this comes from reading
      comprehension. If you make people hold their tongues against the
      roofs of their mouths while they're reading a passage, they show
      poorer comprehension of the text than people who you've gotten to
      do some unrelatedly annoying motor task, like tapping their fingers.

      Pinning the tongue literally pins your inner tongue, muffling your
      inner voice.

      This is an almost bizzarely prosaic explanation for something that
      seems so intimate: our inner voice.
      
      If this is happening, surely we could detect it? And even do speech
      recognition on it?
Subvocal Speech Recognition:
  img: mit-silent-speech.jpg
  bg: black
  note: |
    Yes, we can.

    Arnav Kapur at MIT has built a proof of concept silent computing platform,
    which uses speech recognition via Electromyography—reading the electrical
    impulses sent to your muscles.
    
    Using this input, the system is able to perform speech recognition on
    the words you're saying in your head. It can reply to you as well, via
    bone transduction.

    All this to create a silent computing platform that can be an
    “intelligence augmentation device.”

    It recognizes the question you're saying in your head, asks
    Google about it, and answers by vibrating the bones of your jaw.
Not Just Stories:
  bg: black
  note: |
    Subvocalization is fascinating to me because it highlights our bodies
    role in constructing the experience of language.

    We think of language as airy and disembodied, and this phenomena gives
    lie to that: language, as we experience it, depends on the body, comes
    from the body.

    We are not just stories.

    We are stories embedded in flesh.
    
    We are stories that grow from our squishy, meaty bodies. From the
    incredible amount of data they receive on a daily basis. From
    the billions of years of evolution that brought us to that point.

    This beautiful tree, drawn by Mina Sundberg, just shows the old world
    languages, those from Europe and Asia.
    
    Most of them are descended from Proto-Indo-European, a language by people
    in the Ural steppes about six thousand years ago.

    There are, of course, many more.
Power of Language:

      anything. In fact, you can't do anything.
  Crackling campfire:

    note: |
      It just happens. This little cognitive superpower allows us to
      operate on the hypotheses using the the tools of
      physical manipulation.
  As coders:
    html: c² = a² + b²    
    note: |
      As creators, and particularly as coders, I think we develop
      an intuitive grasp of this. We have physicalized inner
      worlds that represent the abstract things we work with every day.

      I see this? The triangle pops into my head.

      How does that work?
