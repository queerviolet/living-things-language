    Hi everyone. Has everyone been having a good time here at Codemotion?
        
    Good.
    
    I'm Ashi. And I'm here to share some observations about living things.

    Before we begin, I want us to remember that we are living things.
    
    So take a deep breath.

      Remember that you have a body.
      
      Remember your lungs, peeling open to draw in air
      so the hemoglobin inside them can release CO2 and trap oxygen.
      
      You are alive, so you are made up of living things.
      
      Remember the cells of your body. Remember the fibers of your muscles.

      Remember your heart, squeezing and squishing your blood around to drive
      oxidization in your cells.
      
      Remember that oxidization is burning, and so inside of you are thirty seven
      trillion tiny fires.
      
      Remember the crackling of depolarizing membranes in your brain, neurons
      strobing with information.
      
      You are alive, so you are a part of living things. You are a cell
      within tissues shaped like cities and families and nations.

      You are alive, so you hvae come from living things.
      Remember your ancestors. Remember the story that has brought you here.
      Remember your past.

      Remember... about ten years ago.

  Networked:

  Socially networked:
    frame: socially-networked
    note: |
      *socially* networked, made by us, consumed by us.
      Bloggers and tweeters sharing their worlds with each other.
      
      All of us creators, all of us consumers.

      No longer would we be beholden to newspapers, to reporters. No longer would
      we get our stories filtered through layers of intermediaries,
      each one spinning and slanting. No, we would just get the truth.
      The truth would win.
      
      Of course, there were nay sayers. Negative nancies.
      "Journalists", "researchers", asking...
      okay, well, how? How, exactly? How do you know people are who they
      say they are? How can you trust these faceless barely-people,
      veiled by layers of cable and protocol?

      And our response—my response, certainly, the one I said on the
      inside—was that it's... fine... probably. Something something
      web of trust. Wisdom of crowds.

  A New Culture:

    note: |
      We have been weaving ourselves a new culture.

      Connecting in a new way.
  Without Nations and Borders:
    frame: fist2
    class: black
    note: |
      Richer. More direct.
      Organic. We are becoming something, all of us together
      becoming something greater than any of us. It seemed,
      then, that we were struck by lightning, and far from
      killing us, it gave us life, and our mycelium was bearing fruit.
      
      This is why we built everything. Remember that feeling?
      The promise of the Internet, of cyberspace, this new kind
      of a place without nations and borders, a place where
      authoritarians fear to tread.
  Punch Only Masks:

    class: black
    note: |
      A place where their iron fists can punch only masks;
      where their walls cannot be built because the network perceives
      their censorship as damage and routes around it. Where we rely
      on each other. On consensus. On the wisdom of the mob.
      A place where every story can be told, true or not.
  Racism:
    frame: kekistan
    ungrouped: true
    class: black
    note: |
      A place where
      your footprints can follow you forever. A place where you can
      be yourself and so can anyone else; a place where everyone can
      find their people and dance in 14/88 time;
  New Minds:
    frame: eye0
    class: black
    note: |
      a place where new minds
      are growing, and they’re sprouting eyes everywhere, and their
      hands are everywhere, and they are learning from us how to be
      human and so far they can reliably emulate three things

  Retrospect:
    class: black
    note: |
      In retrospect, those journalists, those researchers,
      everyone concerned, perhaps even alarmed about how we would
      be able to trust anything in a world with amplification and
      no accountability? They had a really solid point. Just...very solid.
      Good job, Cassandra. We probably should have listened.

      Yeah. But we didn’t.
      
      And now, we’re all... completely fucked.
  What happened:
    class: black
    note: |
      Maybe.
      
      It certainly seems that way sometimes.
      
      I believe life will thrive.
      I believe we will touch the stars.
      I believe we will grow cities from trees,
      I believe we will create space for all living things.
      I believe in us.
      
      But goodness, we don't make it easy.

      I mean, Uncle Sam, always a bit of a crotchety racist,
      is *really* not looking so hot these days.
      
      And it's not just him. There's a lot of scary things happening
      all over the world.
      
      I wouldn't have believed it if you'd told me ten years ago.
  May not believe it now:
    class: black
    note: |
      In fact, I get a lot of my news from Twitter, so I probably shouldn't
      believe it now.

      What’s the saying? Falsehood flies, truth comes limping after.
      And this makes sense! We should expect this.

      There are so very, very many things that can go wrong, it's a miracle
      we are able to communicate anything at all.

      But we do. Reliably, repeatedly.

      You see these words, and you go somewhere nice. You don't have to do
      anything. In fact, you can't do anything.

    note: |
      It just happens. This little cognitive superpower allows us to
      operate on the hypotheses using the the tools of
      physical manipulation.
  As coders:
    html: c² = a² + b²
    note: |
      As creators, and particularly as coders, I think we develop
      an intuitive grasp of this. We have physicalized inner
      worlds that represent the abstract things we work with every day.

      I see this? The triangle pops into my head.

      How does that work?
