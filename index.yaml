Hi:

  simplify: *simplify_title
  note: |
    Hi, my name's Ashi. Today's talk is the first in a series called
    *Living Things*. This one is about language.

    We've all heard that languages are living things. I think we treat this
    as metaphor. Languages that are spoken by people today—those we call "alive".
    Languages that are no longer spoken—or are only spoken by a select
    group of academics—those we describe as "dead".

    For the next thirty minutes, I want you to try and take this
    as literally as possible. Hopefully I'll do a bit to convince you
    of this. Languages do not breathe, they do not
    metabolize, but they do shape the worlds of their speakers,
    they reproduce, they consume resources, they come into equilibria
    with their environments—environments which, notably, include our minds
    and bodies.

    Language is powerful. Ancient and contemporary magical systems rely
    on the power of naming. The names we give to the things in our world
    create that world. You've heard, I'm sure, that the hardest
    problem in computer science is giving name to things. And that's
    because names matter. Names are connected to meanings, linked into
    this web of implications that fishes out of the depths of our minds
    everything from machine schematics to childhood trauma.

    Language has a reputation for being airy. Disconnected from the
    physical. From our bodies. "Shhhhhh," your lover might say. No
    talking now. Just dance.

    But this reputation, I think, conceals a vital truth: language
    is a thing of the body. Our bodies are made for language. For sign,
    for speech, for song. And language is a thing that grows out of
    our bodies, is rooted in movement, has evolved with us, and is as
    much a thing of our bodies as our thumbs, as our frontal cortex,
    as our dance.

    So right now...
Remember:
  frame: title
  simplify: *simplify_title
  note: |
    I want you to remember.

    Remember that you have a body.
    
    Remember your lungs, peeling open to draw in air
    so the hemoglobin inside them can release CO2 and trap oxygen.
    
    You are alive, so you are made up of living things.
    
    Remember the cells of your body. Remember the fibers of your muscles.

    Remember your heart, squeezing and squishing your blood around to drive
    oxidization in your cells.
    
    Remember that oxidization is burning, and so inside of you are thirty seven
    trillion tiny fires.
    
    Remember the crackling of depolarizing membranes in your brain, neurons
    strobing with information.
    
    You are alive, so you are a part of living things. You are a cell
    within tissues shaped like cities and families and nations.

    You are alive, so you hvae come from living things.
    Remember your ancestors. Remember the story that has brought you here.
    Remember your past.

    Remember... about ten years ago.

    note: |
      *socially* networked, made by us, consumed by us.
      Bloggers and tweeters sharing their worlds with each other.
      
      All of us creators, all of us consumers.

      No longer would we be beholden to newspapers, to reporters. No longer would
      we get our stories filtered through layers of intermediaries,
      each one spinning and slanting. No, we would just get the truth.
      The truth would win.
      
      Of course, there were nay sayers. Negative nancies.
      "Journalists", "researchers", asking...
      okay, well, how? How, exactly? How do you know people are who they
      say they are? How can you trust these faceless barely-people,
      veiled by layers of cable and protocol?

      And our response—my response, certainly, the one I said on the
      inside—was that it's... fine... probably. Something something
      web of trust. Wisdom of crowds.

      Richer. More direct.
      Organic. We are becoming something, all of us together
      becoming something greater than any of us. It seemed,
      then, that we were struck by lightning, and far from
      killing us, it gave us life, and our mycelium was bearing fruit.
      
      This is why we built everything. Remember that feeling?
      The promise of the Internet, of cyberspace, this new kind
      of a place without nations and borders, a place where
      authoritarians fear to tread.

      A place where their iron fists can punch only masks;
      where their walls cannot be built because the network perceives
      their censorship as damage and routes around it. Where we rely
      on each other. On consensus. On the wisdom of the mob.
      A place where every story can be told, true or not.

      find their people and dance in 14/88 time;
  New Minds:

      a place where new minds
      are growing, and they’re sprouting eyes everywhere, and their
      hands are everywhere, and they are learning from us how to be
      human and so far they can reliably emulate three things

  Retrospect:

      In retrospect, those journalists, those researchers,
      everyone concerned, perhaps even alarmed about how we would
      be able to trust anything in a world with amplification and
      no accountability? They had a really solid point. Just...very solid.
      Good job, Cassandra. We probably should have listened.

      Yeah. But we didn’t.
      
      And now, we’re all... completely fucked.
  What happened:
    bg: black
    note: |
      Maybe.
      
      It certainly feels that way sometimes.
      
      I believe life will thrive.
      I believe we will touch the stars.
      I believe we will grow cities from trees,
      I believe we will create space for all living things.
      I believe in us.
      
      But goodness, we don't make it easy.

      I mean, Uncle Sam, always a bit of a crotchety racist,
      is *really* not looking so hot these days.
      
      And it's not just him. There's a lot of scary things happening
      all over the world.
      
      I wouldn't have believed it if you'd told me ten years ago.
  May not believe it now:
    bg: black
    note: |
      In fact, I get a lot of my news from Twitter, so I only kindof
      believe it now.

      What’s the saying? Falsehood flies, truth comes limping after.
      And this makes sense! We should expect this.

      There are so very, very many things that can go wrong in
      communication, it's a miracle we are able to communicate anything
      at all.

      But we do. Reliably, repeatedly, across great distances.

      With a powerful new technology.

      That technology is language.

      You may disagree with me calling language a technology.
      
      You may say it's not physical. But as all of us here at this programming
      language conference know, technologies do not have to be physical.

      It doesn't have a singular inventor, either. In fact,
      some elements of language acquisition seem to be hardwired into
      us. Communities will create language if it isn't given to them.

      But many of our technologies do not have singular inventors. Many
      of them have been discovered and re-discovered time and again,
      in many different places.

      There's a lot of theories on how language came to be.

Origins of Language:  
  note: |
    One theory, favored by Noam Chomsky, says that it arose suddenly, about
    100,000 years ago, the result of a small number of mutations in a singular
    individual that gave that person's brain the ability to process what Chomsky
    calls "digital infinity". You may know it by its other name: recursion.
  
Recursion:
  htmlFunc: |
    () => `<div class=pan-content-up>${
      Array.from({length: 5}, () => `<div class=layer>&#8220;It
        was a dark and stormy night, and the captain said to the bosun,
        <p>&#8220;Tell us a tale,&#8221;
        <p>And the bosun began,`).join('')
    }${Array.from({length: 5}, () => '</div>').join('')}</div>`
  note: |
    I think we all know and love recursion.
  
  Opens but never closes:
    bg: threed
    note: |
      In this story, the recursive frames open, but never close. That's the joke.
      That's also what makes it, for lack of a better term, so *tingly* to experience.

      You have this real sense of infinity, of this capacity with ourselves to begin
      in each moment a new story, embedded within the last.

      <span class=p>that killed
        <span class=p>the bird
          <span class=p>that ate
            <span class=p>the rat
              <span class=p>that ate
                <span class=p>the cheese</span>

            </span>
          </span>
        </span>
      </span>
    </span>
  note: |
      Of course, more common phrases feature recursive embedding.  
  Embedding:
    bg: p-expand
    note: |
      All human languages contain the ability to expand at least some of their
      phrases indefinitely.

      Here, we can keep expanding this noun phrase by adding complementizers,
      which themselves contain noun phrases, creating the possibility of an infinitely
      long sentence, created from a finite number of rules.

    A perfusion of languages spread across the globe.

    This beautiful tree, by Mina Sundberg, just shows the old world languages,
    those from Europe and Asia.
    
    Most of them are descended from Proto-Indo-European, a language by people
    in the Ural steppes about six thousand years ago.
Power of Language:

    note: |
      You see these words, and you go somewhere nice. You don't have to do
      anything. In fact, you can't do anything.
  Crackling campfire:
    html: A crackling campfire on an ice cold night.
    note: |
      It just happens. This little cognitive superpower allows us to
      operate on the hypotheses using the the tools of
      physical manipulation.
  As coders:
    html: c² = a² + b²    
    note: |
      As creators, and particularly as coders, I think we develop
      an intuitive grasp of this. We have physicalized inner
      worlds that represent the abstract things we work with every day.

      I see this? The triangle pops into my head.

      How does that work?
